# LAUNCH CHECKLIST — RC-402 / RC-403

The ordered list of things that must be true before rapidconstruct.md points at
Vercel. Tick nothing you have not verified in a browser or a test.

---

## 1. 🔴 BLOCKER — the canonical domain is not decided or set

**Nothing else on this list matters until this is done.**

Every absolute SEO URL the site emits — `<link rel="canonical">`, all three
`hreflang` alternates, every `<loc>` in `sitemap.xml`, the `Host:` line in
`robots.txt`, and `og:image` — is built from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

**Current state: the Vercel project has ZERO environment variables.** With the
variable unset the build falls back to `https://rapidconstruct-web.vercel.app`.
That fallback is *correct for previews* and *catastrophic in production*: it
would tell Google that the real domain is a duplicate of the staging host, on
the exact day we hand it the real domain.

Since 2026-07-22 a production build **fails loudly** rather than shipping the
staging host (`src/i18n/metadata.ts`). Verified both ways: the build exits 1
without the variable and succeeds with it.

**To do:**
1. Decide apex vs www. This is a real choice, not a formality:
   - `https://rapidconstruct.md` (apex) — matches the current Tilda URLs, so the
     301s from old pages land on the same host with no extra redirect hop.
     **Recommended.**
   - `https://www.rapidconstruct.md` — apex then 301s to www; one extra hop from
     every legacy URL.
2. Set it in Vercel, Production scope:
   ```
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL production
   ```
3. Redeploy and re-run §2 below. The value must have no trailing slash.

## 2. Verify after the variable is set

Run against the production deployment, not a preview:

- [ ] `curl -s https://<host>/robots.txt` — `Host:` and `Sitemap:` both show the
      real domain.
- [ ] `curl -s https://<host>/sitemap.xml | grep -c "<loc>"` — 28 URLs
      (14 routes × 2 locales), all on the real domain.
- [ ] Spot-check three pages: `canonical`, `hrefLang="ro"`, `hrefLang="ru"`,
      `hrefLang="x-default"` all absolute and on the real domain.
- [ ] `og:image` resolves (open it in a browser, expect an image not a 404).

## 3. Redirects from the old Tilda URLs

- [x] 21-case redirect suite passes (`tests/redirects.spec.ts`), including
      follow-to-200 guards so a redirect can never land on a 404 again.
- [ ] Re-run the suite **against production** after cutover — the suite currently
      proves the rules, not the live DNS.

## 4. Content and indexing

- [x] `/portofoliu` exists in RO + RU with real project photos (RC-104,
      2026-07-22). It is in the sitemap and the nav link resolves.
- [ ] **Q-07 — the claimed numbers.** Any "15 ani", "30 de ani garanție",
      project counts etc. must be confirmed true by the owner before they are
      published. Publishing an unverified claim is both a trust and a legal risk.
- [ ] **Q-10 — calculator prices.** The roof calculator quotes money; the
      numbers must be the owner's real ones.
- [ ] Titles: several exceed ~60 characters and will truncate in Google results.
      Not a blocker, but a cheap pre-launch win (see §7).

## 5. Lead capture — the site's actual job

- [ ] **Q-09 — Resend API key.** Without it the contact form cannot deliver.
      A launched site that silently drops enquiries is worse than no launch.
- [ ] **Q-03 — where leads go** (email / Telegram / both).
- [ ] Submit the real form on production and confirm the lead arrives.

## 6. Analytics (RC-404)

- [ ] GA4 or Plausible installed.
- [ ] Events: call-click, form submit, chat open, calculator completion.
- [ ] Google Search Console verified, sitemap submitted.
- [ ] Google Business Profile updated to the new URL (`docs/GBP-REVIEWS.md`).

## 7. Nice-to-have before launch

- [ ] Shorten over-long titles (20+ pages at 67–83 chars).
- [ ] RU slugs (RC-201) — RU currently uses the RO paths (`/ru/acoperisuri`).
      Real Russian slugs would target `ремонт крыши`-class queries better.
      A post-launch change means another round of redirects, so doing it before
      cutover is cheaper.
- [ ] Q-08 — disable Vercel deployment protection so the owner can open preview
      links without logging in.

## 8. Cutover day

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, redeploy, re-verify §2.
2. Add the domain in Vercel; update DNS.
3. Watch for https, correct canonical, and old URLs 301-ing.
4. Submit the sitemap in Search Console.
5. Keep Tilda reachable until the new site is confirmed serving.

## Verified state as of 2026-07-22

Audited all 28 routes (14 × 2 locales) on a local production-equivalent render:

- All 200 except `/portofoliu`, which **now exists** (was the only 404).
- canonical present on every page ✓
- hreflang ro/ru/x-default present on every page ✓ (rendered as `hrefLang`,
  which is valid — HTML attributes are case-insensitive)
- JSON-LD parses on every page, zero broken blocks ✓
- exactly one `<h1>` per page ✓
- og:title + og:image present on every page ✓
- sitemap 200, robots 200, llms.txt 200 ✓
- **every absolute URL still points at the staging host** — §1
